### Workflow :

#### Step 1 :
   Load the Imdb_Movies dataset through pandas library.
#### Step 2 : 
  Clean the  Imdb_Movies dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types as necessary. Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency and stored the dataframe as a new .csv file.
#### Step 3 :
  Develop a PowerBI  application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Imdb_Movies dataset to create interactive plot.
#### Step 4 :
  Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize for correlation between movie ratings and other factors like genre, director, budget, etc.
